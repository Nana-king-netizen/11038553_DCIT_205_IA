# WHAT IV'E LEARNED FROM THE PROJECT
Throughout the development of this project, I have gained valuable experience in:
Frontend development using HTML, CSS and little bit of Javascript.
I've also learnt that constant practice will make you better at this
Still finding difficulties with the Git control and collaboration and due to this i had to create all the pages and get help from someone to show me how to commit and make the pull request ...how to make a page responsive to other devices is another difficulty for me and I am still learning to improve on them

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. Thank you for visiting University Of Ghana Computer science Department!
