    <h2>UG updates email forwarding service</h2>
    <p>Over the course of this upcoming academic year, UG will discontinue its alumni email forwarding service and offer alumni either a free Google Workspace account, allowing them to keep UG email address, or an invitation to update their email address to a preferred one instead.</p>
    <P>Why make this change now? “The world and especially the big email providers are clamping down on email authentication,” said Mildred Mami-Tei, director of cloud infrastructure services at UG. “They are less tolerant of emails that appear to be spoofed.”</P>
